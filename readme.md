Rainfy app used to predict whether it will rain the next day or not based on certain input parameters created using python's scikit-learn, fastapi, numpy and joblib packages.

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No?
This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.

The data contains the following columns:

| Feature Name  | Feature Description                        |
